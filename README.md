W21 ASP.NET Razor Page Project

please create your own working/dev branch <em><strong>yourname-dev-branch</strong></em>, so we can keep the main safe from broken code.
We will ONLY merge the working code to main.

you can create your dev-branch after pull the main by using

  `git switch -c yourname-dev-branch`
  `git checkout -b yourname-dev-branch`

after clone the project and create your branch, run

  `doenet restore`

in your code terminal (inside the project folder), it will restore the dependency packages in the .csproj file.
